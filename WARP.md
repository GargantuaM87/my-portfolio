# WARP.md

This file provides guidance to WARP (warp.dev) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a single-page React portfolio application built with Vite. It heavily uses Tailwind CSS (via `@tailwindcss/vite` and utilities defined in `src/index.css`), GSAP for scroll-based animations, and React Three Fiber / Drei / Three.js for 3D scenes in the hero and contact sections.

Key tooling and libraries:
- Vite (dev server and build) via `vite.config.js`
- React 19 with JSX entry at `src/main.jsx` and root component `src/App.jsx`
- Tailwind CSS 4 with custom utility/component classes in `src/index.css`
- GSAP + ScrollTrigger + `@gsap/react` for section and card animations
- `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei`, and `three` for 3D content
- `@emailjs/browser` for the contact form
- ESLint flat config in `eslint.config.js` (JS + React hooks + React Refresh rules)

## Commands

All commands are defined in `package.json` and use npm (there is a `package-lock.json`). Run these from the repo root.

### Install dependencies

```bash path=null start=null
npm install
```

### Start the dev server

Runs Vite’s dev server.

```bash path=null start=null
npm run dev
```

### Build for production

Creates a production build in `dist/`.

```bash path=null start=null
npm run build
```

### Preview the production build

Serves the built `dist/` output using Vite’s preview server.

```bash path=null start=null
npm run preview
```

### Linting

ESLint is configured via `eslint.config.js` and targets all `*.js`/`*.jsx` files.

```bash path=null start=null
npm run lint
```

Notes for future changes:
- ESLint ignores `dist/`.
- The rule `no-unused-vars` is enabled with `varsIgnorePattern: '^[A-Z_]'`, so keep that in mind when adding constants.

### Tests

There is currently **no test script** configured in `package.json` and no obvious test framework set up. Before adding or running tests, coordinate with the user to choose a test runner (e.g., Vitest or Jest) and add the appropriate `test` script.

## High-Level Architecture

### Entry point and layout

- `index.html` is the Vite entry, mounting React into `#root`.
- `src/main.jsx` imports global styles from `src/index.css` and renders `<App />` inside React’s `StrictMode`.
- `src/App.jsx` composes the main page in order:
  - `NavBar`
  - `Hero`
  - `Showcase`
  - `LogoSection`
  - `Blog`
  - `TechStack`
  - `Contact`
  - `Footer`

This structure makes `App` the single-page layout shell; new major sections should generally be added under `src/sections/` and wired into `App.jsx`.

### Sections vs components

The codebase distinguishes between **page sections** and **reusable components**:

- `src/sections/`
  - **Hero (`hero.jsx`)**: Landing section with a GSAP-animated headline, rotating word slider, CTA button, and the hero 3D scene (`HeroExperience`).
  - **Showcase (`Showcase.jsx`)**: Projects section with GSAP + ScrollTrigger animations applied per project card.
  - **Blog (`Blog.jsx`)**: Blog section highlighting posts and writing, rendered as a simple card grid.
  - **TechStack (`techStack.jsx`)**: Grid of 3D tech logo cards, each rendered via `TechIcon` in its own `Canvas`.
  - **Contact (`Contact.jsx`)**: Contact form plus a 3D “workspace” scene (`ContactExperience`) and EmailJS integration.
  - **Footer (`Footer.jsx`)**: Footer with social icons and dynamic copyright year.
  - `FeatureCards.jsx` is currently a placeholder section.

- `src/components/`
  - **Layout/utility components**: `NavBar`, `TitleHeader`, `LogoSection`, `Button`, `AnimatedCounter`, `GlowCard`, etc. These handle reusable UI patterns and are styled primarily via Tailwind utility classes and component classes in `index.css`.
  - **3D components**:
    - `HeroExperience.jsx` sets up the hero `Canvas`, lights, and orbit controls and includes the `Irene` model.
    - `components/HeroModels/Irene.jsx` defines a 3D character model generated by `gltfjsx`, using `useGLTF`, `useGraph`, and `SkeletonUtils.clone`.
    - `components/Models/TechLogos/TechIcon.jsx` is a generic 3D logo renderer. It loads a GLTF file from `model.modelPath`, optionally tweaks materials, and renders inside its own `Canvas` with `Environment` and `Float` for subtle animation.
    - `components/contact/ContactExperience.jsx` sets up a 3D contact scene with a `Computer` model on a lit plane and `OrbitControls`.

### Data/configuration

- `src/constants/index.js` centralizes most display data:
  - `navLinks` drives the navigation links used in `NavBar`.
  - `words` controls the hero rotating word slider.
  - `counterItems` backs the animated stats in `AnimatedCounter`.
  - `logoIconsList` feeds the scrolling logo marquee in `LogoSection`.
  - `abilities`, `techStackImgs`, `techStackIcons`, `expCards`, `expLogos`, `testimonials`, `socialImgs` drive various content blocks across sections.
- When adding or modifying content, prefer updating this file rather than hardcoding repeated data in components.

### Styling and theming

- Global styles and Tailwind setup live in `src/index.css`:
  - Imports the Mona Sans font and Tailwind.
  - Defines CSS variables and Tailwind `@theme` entries for colors and fonts.
  - Uses `@layer utilities` and `@layer components` to define semantic utility classes (e.g., `flex-center`, `section-padding`, `hero-layout`, `app-showcase`, `cta-button`, `timeline`, `tech-grid`, `footer`).
  - Contains custom keyframe animations and helper classes for:
    - Hero word slider (`.slide`, `.wrapper`, `@keyframes wordSlider`).
    - Marquee carousel in `LogoSection` (`.marquee`, `.marquee-box`, `@keyframes marquee`).
    - Card glow effect used by `GlowCard` (`.card`, `.glow`, `--start` angle, `::before` gradient mask).

Because many sections rely on class names defined here (e.g., `.hero-text`, `.timeline`, `.tech-card`, `.marquee-*`), be careful when renaming classes or altering layout structure; GSAP selectors in sections target these class names directly.

### 3D and animation considerations

- 3D scenes (hero, tech cards, contact section) are all built with React Three Fiber and Drei.
  - Components that use `<Canvas>` (e.g., `HeroExperience`, `TechIcon`, `ContactExperience`) must remain client-side only and should not be rendered on the server.
  - GLTF models are expected to live under the Vite public directory (e.g., `/models/...glb` paths). Updating model paths requires changing both the assets and their `modelPath` fields in `techStackIcons` or the `Irene` component.
- GSAP and ScrollTrigger are wired via `useGSAP` hooks:
  - Sections like `Hero`, `Showcase`, and `Experience` select DOM nodes by class name and apply entrance / scroll animations.
  - When restructuring markup in these sections, update the GSAP selectors to avoid broken animations.

### Contact form and environment variables

- `src/sections/Contact.jsx` uses `@emailjs/browser` and `emailjs.sendForm` with the following environment variables:
  - `VITE_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`
  - `VITE_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID`
  - `VITE_APP_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY`
- These variables must be defined (typically in a `.env` file) for form submission to work. Future modifications to the contact flow should continue to rely on environment variables rather than hardcoding secrets.

## Working Effectively in This Repo (for Agents)

- When adding new major content sections, follow the existing pattern:
  - Create a new component under `src/sections/`.
  - Use `TitleHeader` for consistent headings where appropriate.
  - Wire the new section into `src/App.jsx` in the desired scroll order.
- For new data-driven UI (e.g., additional logos, testimonials, experience items), extend the relevant arrays in `src/constants/index.js` and map over them in components instead of duplicating JSX.
- When modifying or adding animations:
  - Prefer using GSAP via `useGSAP` and keep selectors consistent with class names defined in `src/index.css`.
  - For 3D interactions, reuse the existing patterns in `HeroExperience`, `TechIcon`, and `ContactExperience` (lights, `OrbitControls`, `Float`, `Environment`).
- Keep ESLint configuration in mind when adding new JS/JSX files and hooks; align with the existing flat config in `eslint.config.js`.
